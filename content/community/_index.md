ROR is a collaborative effort driven by multiple organizations and individuals. The community-based aspect of ROR sets it apart from similar efforts in this space. Wide adoption and support across the scholarly research community is central to ROR's growth, sustainability, and success.

## Steering organizations

Steering organizations are responsible for strategic decision-making about governance, sustainability, and overall project direction. Steering organizations have also provided key resources for the startup phase of the project.

The steering organizations and representatives are:

-   [California Digital Library](https://www.cdlib.org) (represented by John Chodacki)
-   [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org) (represented by Ed Pentz)
-   [DataCite](https://www.datacite.org) (represented by Patricia Cruse)
-   [Digital Science](https://wwww.digital-science.com) (represented by Daniel Hook)

## ROR project team

The ROR project team involves members of all four steering organizations. Project team members work on technical implementation, outreach and communications, and product development and management.

The project lead and main point of contact is [Maria Gould](mailto:info@ror.org), product manager at California Digital Library. Project coordination involves two main groups:

### Outreach, communication & adoption

-   Helena Cousijn, DataCite
-   Ginny Hendricks, Crossref
-   Rachael Lammey, Crossref   
-   Suze Kundu, Digital Science

### Technical & product development

-   Geoffrey Bilder, Crossref
-   Esha Datta, Crossref
-   Dominka Tkaczyk, Crossref
-   Martin Fenner, DataCite
-   Robin Dasler, DataCite
-   Brian Kirkegaard Lunn, Digital Science
-   Simon Porter, Digital Science

## ROR Community Advisory Group

A broader community advisory group meets for regular calls and in small working groups to discuss and provide input on key aspects of the project, including data curation processes and data modeling, implementation and adoption of ROR IDs, and outreach and community engagement.

The advisory group includes people from around the world and across different types of institutions/industries (libraries, platform providers, research offices, CRIS systems, vendors, funders, and more).

## Early supporters and advisors

During the early stages of the OrgID initiative, 17 organizations donated their time and expertise to outlining a shared vision for an open registry of organizations:

-   Alfred P. Sloan Foundation
-   American Physical Society
-   California Digital Library
-   Cornell University
-   Crossref
-   DataCite
-   Digital Science
-   Editeur
-   Elsevier
-   Foundation for Earth Sciences
-   Hindawi
-   Jisc
-   ORCID
-   Ringgold
-   Springer Nature
-   The IP Registry
-   U.S. Geological Survey

ROR has also benefited greatly from the help and guidance of Helen Szigeti and Kristen Ratan, who consulted on the OrgID planning process in 2017.
